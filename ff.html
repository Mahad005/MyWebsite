          <article><h2>Final Fantasy Summary</h2>
              <p>Final Fantasy is a RPG series created by Square Soft, later called Square-Enix, that influenced Turned-based RPGs when it first came out in December 18, 1987. It was originally called Final Fantasy because Square Soft was going bankrupt & put all their efforts into one last game, called Final Fantasy.
              The game became a hit & has spawned multiple sequels & spinoffs.</p>

                Each game has their own characters, settings, lore, & locations. One game could be about </p>
            <h1>Gameplay</h1>
              <p>Most of the games feature a turn-based kind of combat. This means that the player & the enemy take turns attacking each other with a multitude of weapons & magic.
              You attack using a menu command where you get to choose how to attack the enemy. After the battle ends, the player gains EXP which, with enough, can level you up, which can make you much stronger. You also gain some money to buy some items to help you along the journey.
            The stronger you are, the more powerful things you are able to do. You can also play as multiple other characters that can do different things, like a character that can copy enemy moves or a character that can attack with button combinations.</p>
