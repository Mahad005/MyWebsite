          <article><h1>My Favorite Franchises</h1>
            <p>I would like to go over some of the best franchises I have ever played, because many of the games I like are from the same franchise.
              <br><strong><a href="doom.html">Doom</a></strong> is one of the best shooters out there, with the exploration & combat.
              <br><strong><a href="ff.html">Final Fantasy</a></strong> is the prime example of what great RPGs should be.
              <br>And <strong><a href="smash.html">Super Smash Bros.</a></strong> have some of the greatest fighting games of all time.</p>
