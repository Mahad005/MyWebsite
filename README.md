          <article><h1>My favorite franchises</h1>
            <p>I would like to go over some of the best franchises I have ever played, because many of the games I like are from the same franchise.
              <br><strong>Doom</strong> is one of the best shooters out there, with the exploration & combat.
              <br><strong>Final Fantasy</strong> is the prime example of what great RPGs should be.
              <br>And <strong>Super Smash Bros.</strong> have some of the greatest fighting games of all time.</p>
